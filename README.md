# YOLO: Real-Time Object Detection#
You only look once (YOLO) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. On a Pascal Titan X it processes images at 30 FPS and has a mAP of 57.9% on COCO test-dev.

The original YOLO run with [darknet](http://pjreddie.com/darknet) which is an open source neural network framework written in C and CUDA. It is fast, easy to install, and supports CPU and GPU computation.

This project is a modified version for some requirements such as save labes or video.
